# DISEASE ECOLOGY PRIMER

## What is Disease Ecology?

- the ecological study of host-pathogen interactions within the context of their environment and evolution.

- a field of study that investigates the relationship between pathogens (like bacteria, viruses, and parasites) and their hosts, as well as the influence of the environment and evolution on disease transmission and spread.

- the mechanisms, patterns, and effects of host-pathogen interactions, particularly those of infectious diseases.

- how pathogens interact with their host environment and how they are able to colonize new hosts, sometimes becoming more or potentially less pathogenic.

## Research Question

- Can we identify and model behavioral differences (across the spectrum of food availability) that may impact the risk of HeV spillover?

## Research Questions

1.  What factors impact CoV prevalence in Mexican Free Tailed bats?

2.  Is there evidence of viral spillback in Mexican Free Tailed bats?

## Statistical Challenges

1. Preferential Sampling
2. Pooled Testing
